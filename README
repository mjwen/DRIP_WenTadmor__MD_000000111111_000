This directory (DRIP_WenTadmor__MD_000000111111_000) contains the
Dihedral-angle-corrected registry-dependent interlayer potential (DRIP) Model
Driver.

The DRIP potential provides a description of the interlayer interactions of
layered materials. See reference 1 for the functional form implemented in this
Model Driver. To give a full description of the interactions of layered materials,
it needs to be used together with another potential that provides the intralayer
descriptions.

This Model Driver reads one parameters file, and its format is as follows:

- Blank lines and lines starting with the `#' character are ignored.

- 1st line: number of atom species (has to be 1 currently)

- 2nd line: species, C0, C2, C4, C, delta, lambda, A, z0, B, eta, rho_cutoff, cutoff
    species is a valid KIM API particle species string
    C0, C2, C4, C, A, and B in [eV]
    delta, z0, eta, rho_cutoff, and cutoff in [Angstrom]
    lambda in [1/Angstrom]
